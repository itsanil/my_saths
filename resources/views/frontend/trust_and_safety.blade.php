<p>We SAATH E-COMMERCE PRIVATE LIMITED'S take our responsibility as My Saathe stewards very seriously. It's our job to provide a system deserving of your trust - by proactively screening for potential problems, by investigating issues brought to us by our community, and by still being exceedingly clear that even with these steps not every project will go as planned.</p>

<p>Our goal is to provide a safe and trusted platform where people are honest and open with one another as they collaborate to bring creative projects to life.</p>
<br/><br/>
<h5>What everyone should know</h5>
<ul class="policy">
    <li>My Saathe is not a store. People aren't buying things that already exist - they're helping to create new things. Creating things isn't always easy. Some projects will go wonderfully, and others will run into obstacles. Be prepared for a little bit of each.</li>
<li>Creators are responsible for their projects. When you back a project, you're trusting the creator to do a good job, so if you don't know them personally or by reputation, do a little research first. My Saathe doesn't evaluate a project's claims, resolve disputes, or offer refunds - backers decide what's worth funding and what's not.</li>
<li>Some projects won't go as planned. Even with a creator's best efforts, a project may not work out the way everyone hopes. My Saathe creators have a remarkable track record, but nothing's guaranteed. Keep this in mind when you back a project.</li>
<li>We monitor the system. Our Integrity team uses complex algorithms and automated tools to identify and investigate suspicious activity on projects.</li>
 <li>We take action. Sometimes that just means asking someone to fix a problem. But when we find users or projects that abuse the system, we don't hesitate to suspend them.</li>
 <li>Beware of "phishing." Phishing is when someone pretends to be a business you trust and asks for sensitive information. My Saathe will never ask for your Social Security number or full payment information over the phone or by email, and the only place we'll ask you to enter your password is on My Saathe log-in screen. If anyone asks you for this information, or you think you've received a scam or hoax email from someone pretending to be affiliated with us, don't respond - just let us know.</li>
</ul>
