            <h2>FUNDRAISING IDEAS</h2>
             <p class="para_1">For decades now, we have been relying on traditional fundraising methods (eg. door to door campaigns, phone calls, distributing flyers) to support a good cause but they can often prove to be time, money and effort consuming. That's why, despite their good intentions so many people shy away from raising funds for a good cause.</p>

<p>On the other hand, often times people make a donation to their favourite cause and but the story ends there. There are no tools for them to easily multiply their impact by inviting their friends and family to pool in their funds to create even more social impact.</p>

<p>Crowdfunding is a perfect solution for those who want to make a difference but are too busy to use the traditional methods of fundraising! Having said that, we do understand that many of you are still warming up to the concept of crowdfunding.</p>

<p>This is where; we come in to the picture. We make crowdfunding easy, fun and cost effective. Creating an online crowdfunding campaign on Mysaathe is absolutely free and can be done in less than 60 seconds. Our platform is very user friendly thereby making it enjoyable to create new campaigns, to promote and share them through social media, and to raise funds through all payment options (cash, check, debit card, credit card), all at the convenience of your home (or anywhere you choose to be).</p>

<p>Non-profits can use crowdfunding to achieve their fundraising targets for specific programs. Moreover, individuals and corporates can also create campaigns to support programs run by various non-profit organizations they support.</p>

<p>Here are some of the ideas, to kick start some of your social crowdfunding endeavours</p>
