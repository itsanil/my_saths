comply with all of the provisions set forth in the Agreement, which  Saath ecommerce pvt ltd&#39;s

all international, federal, state and local laws governing their Saath ecommerce pvt ltd&#39;s

questions regarding any policy or rule, do not hesitate to seek an answer from the  Saath
ecommerce pvt ltd&#39;s Mysaathe website   corporate office.</p>

following methods: (a) posting on the Company&#39;s official website; (b) electronic mail (email); (c)

The continuation of a Manager&#39;s Saath ecommerce pvt ltd&#39;s Mysaathe website   project

<br/><br/>
<h5>2.4 - Delays</h5>
<p>Saath ecommerce pvt ltd&#39;s Mysaathe website   shall not be responsible for delays or
failures in performance of its obligations when performance is made commercially

supply, government decrees or orders, and acts of God.</p>

<br/><br/>
<h5>2.5 - Policies and Provisions Severable</h5>
<p>If any provision of the Agreement, in its current form or as may be amended, is found to be
invalid, or unenforceable for any reason, only the invalid portion(s) of the provision shall be
severed and the remaining terms and provisions shall remain in full force and effect and shall
be construed as if such invalid or unenforceable provision never comprised a part of the
Agreement.</p>

<br/><br/>
<h5>2.6 - Waiver</h5>
<p>The Company never gives up its right to insist on compliance with the Agreement and with the
applicable laws governing the conduct of a project. No failure of  Saath ecommerce pvt ltd&#39;s
Mysaathe website  CrowdFunding to exercise any right or power under the Agreement
or to insist upon strict compliance by an Manager with any obligation or provision of the
Agreement, and no custom or practice of the parties at variance with the terms of the
Agreement, shall constitute a waiver of  Saath ecommerce pvt ltd&#39;s
Mysaathe website   right to demand exact compliance with the Agreement. Waiver
by  Saath ecommerce pvt ltd&#39;s Mysaathe website   can be affected only in writing by an
authorized officer of the Company.  Saath ecommerce pvt ltd&#39;s
Mysaathe website   waiver of any particular breach by a Manager shall not affect or
impair Saath ecommerce pvt ltd&#39;s Mysaathe website   rights with respect to any
subsequent breach, nor shall it affect in any way the rights or obligations of any other Manager.
Nor shall any delay or omission by  Saath ecommerce pvt ltd&#39;s Mysaathe website   to
exercise any right arising from a breach affect or impair  Saath ecommerce pvt ltd&#39;s
Mysaathe website  rights as to that or any subsequent breach. The existence of any
claim or cause of action of a Manager against  Saath ecommerce pvt ltd&#39;s
Mysaathe website   shall not constitute a defense to  Saath ecommerce pvt ltd&#39;s
Mysaathe website  enforcement of any term or provision of the Agreement.</p>

Formula Managers must adhere to the terms of the  Saath ecommerce pvt ltd&#39;s
Mysaathe website Share Distribution Formula as set forth in official  Saath ecommerce
pvt ltd&#39;s Mysaathe website literature.</h5>

<p>Managers shall not offer the Saath ecommerce pvt ltd&#39;s Mysaathe website   benefits
through, or in combination with, any other system, program or method of marketing other than
that specifically set forth in official Saath ecommerce pvt ltd&#39;s Mysaathe website 
literature. Managers shall not require or encourage Managers to participate in  Saath

ecommerce pvt ltd&#39;s Mysaathe website in any manner that varies from the program as
set forth in official  Saath ecommerce pvt ltd&#39;s Mysaathe website literature. Managers
shall not require or encourage other current or prospective Managers to execute any
agreement or contract other than official  Saath ecommerce pvt ltd&#39;s
Mysaathe website agreements and contracts in order to become a  Saath ecommerce
pvt ltd&#39;s Mysaathe website Manager. Similarly, Managers shall not require or
encourage other current or prospective Managers to make any purchase from, or payment to,
any individual or other entity to participate in the Saath ecommerce pvt ltd&#39;s

Mysaathe website literature.</p>

<br/><br/>
<h5>4.2 - Project Funding (Share) Waiver</h5>

accordance with the Share Distribution Formula, that they prefer to not share to that specific
project; each Manager shall be allocated one sharing waiver from the seven (7) projects listed.
If Manager elects to waive share funding to one project, an alternative project shall be made
available at Company&#39;s sole discretion from a Company list, so as to not interfere with the
integrity of the Share Distribution Formula, but still allow the individual Manager discretion in
sharing. There shall be no more than one waiver allowed per Manager.</p>

<br/><br/>
<h5>4.3 - Business Entities</h5>
<p>A Partnership, LLC or Corporation may hold a Managership upon completion of the Manager
Application form. However, an individual may not participate in more than one (1) project. The
person signing the application on behalf of a business entity must have the authority of said
entity for entering into the transaction. In addition, by signing for as a business entity, you
certify that no person with an interest of debt or equity in the business has had an interest in a
project in  Saath ecommerce pvt ltd&#39;s Mysaathe website  within six (6) months of the
date of signature.</p>

<br/><br/>
<h5>4.4 - Changes to a Saath ecommerce pvt ltd&#39;s Mysaathe website Project</h5>
<p>4.4.1 - General
Each Manager must immediately notify  Saath ecommerce pvt ltd&#39;s
Mysaathe website of all changes to the information contained in his or her Manager
Application and Agreement. Managers may modify their existing Manager Agreement Form by
submitting a written request and appropriate supporting documentation.</p>
<p>4.4.2 - Change of Referrer
To protect the integrity of all marketing organizations and safeguard the hard work of all
Managers,  Saath ecommerce pvt ltd&#39;s Mysaathe website  does not allow changes in
Referrer for active Managers. Maintaining the integrity of Referrer is critical for the success of

every Manager and marketing organization. Accordingly, the transfer of a  Saath ecommerce
pvt ltd&#39;s Mysaathe website  CrowdFunding project from one Referrer to another is not
permitted.
Exception - A request for a change in Referrer, due toSaath ecommerce pvt ltd&#39;s
Mysaathe website CrowdFunding error, will be accepted within 45 days of completion
of the application.<p>
<p>4.4.3 - Cancellation and Re-application
A Manager may legitimately change organizations by:<br/>
a) Voluntarily cancelling his or her  Saath ecommerce pvt ltd&#39;s
Mysaathe website Agreement and remaining inactive (i.e., no referring; and no
attendance at any  Saath ecommerce pvt ltd&#39;s Mysaathe website functions, participation
in any other form of Manager activity, or operation of any other  Saath ecommerce pvt ltd&#39;s
Mysaathe website CrowdFunding project) for 6 full calendar months.
Following the 6 calendar month period of inactivity, the former Manager may reapply under a
new Referrer. However the former Manager will permanently lose any and all right to their
former Manager organization.<p>

<br/><br/>
<h5>4.5 - Unauthorized Claims and Actions</h5>
<p>4.5.1 - Indemnification<br/>
A Manager is fully responsible for all of his or her verbal and written statements made
regarding  Saath ecommerce pvt ltd&#39;s Mysaathe website projects and the Share
Distribution Formula that are not expressly contained in official  Saath ecommerce pvt ltd&#39;s
Mysaathe website materials. Managers agree to indemnify  Saath ecommerce pvt ltd&#39;s
Mysaathe website  and  Saath ecommerce pvt ltd&#39;s Mysaathe website  directors,
officers, employees and agents and hold them harmless from any and all liability, including
judgments, civil penalties, refunds, attorney fees, court costs or lost business incurred by  Saath
ecommerce pvt ltd&#39;s Mysaathe website  as a result of the Manager&#39;s unauthorized
representations or actions. This provision shall survive the termination of the Manager
Agreement.</p>
<p>4.5.2 - Sharing/Income Claims<br/>
In their enthusiasm to enroll prospective Managers, some Managers are occasionally tempted
to make exaggerated funds received claims or representations to demonstrate the inherent
power of crowd funding. This is counterproductive because new Managers may become
disappointed very quickly if their results are not as extensive or as rapid as the results others
have achieved. Moreover, the Federal Trade Commission and all states and most countries have
laws or regulations that regulate or even prohibit certain types of such claims and testimonials
made by persons engaged in this activity. While Managers may believe it beneficial to disclose
the sharing results for themselves or others, such approaches have legal consequences that can
negatively impact  Saath ecommerce pvt ltd&#39;s Mysaathe website  as well as the Manager

making the claim unless appropriate disclosures required by law are also made
contemporaneously with the income claim or earnings representation.</p>

<br/><br/>
<h5>4.6 - Conduct at  Saath ecommerce pvt ltd&#39;s Mysaathe website Events</h5>
<p>4.6.1 - Selling or Recruiting at  Saath ecommerce pvt ltd&#39;s
Mysaathe website   CrowdFunding events is not permitted. These activities take away
from the primary focus of the event, and can negatively reflect on the professional image
of  Saath ecommerce pvt ltd&#39;s Mysaathe website  as a company. You may, however,
offer a business card.</p>
<p>4.6.2 - No Selling or Recruiting for other Companies at  Saath ecommerce pvt ltd&#39;s
Mysaathe website   Events
Saath ecommerce pvt ltd&#39;s Mysaathe website  Managers shall not sell any products or
recruit for any business during  Saath ecommerce pvt ltd&#39;s Mysaathe websiteevents. This
restriction most specifically applies to sales and recruitment efforts for any direct sales or
marketing program, regardless of the product category, including those that do not compete
with  Saath ecommerce pvt ltd&#39;s Mysaathe website.</p>

<br/><br/>
<h5>4.7 - Conflicts of Interest</h5>
<p>4.7.1 - Non-compete Policy<br/>
Saath ecommerce pvt ltd&#39;s Mysaathe website   Managers are free to participate in any
sales, direct sales, multilevel or network marketing business ventures or marketing
opportunities (collectively &quot;network marketing&quot;). Managers may not display  Saath ecommerce
pvt ltd&#39;s Mysaathe website   projects, services, or products with any other products or
services in a fashion that might in any way confuse or mislead a prospective customer,
merchant or Manager into believing there is a relationship between the  Saath ecommerce pvt
ltd&#39;s Mysaathe website   and non- Saath ecommerce pvt ltd&#39;s
Mysaathe website   products or services.</p>
<p>4.7.2 - Non-solicitation<br/>
During the term of this Agreement, Managers may not recruit other  Saath ecommerce pvt ltd&#39;s
Mysaathe website  Managers for any other business. Following the cancellation of this
Agreement, and for a period of one year thereafter, a former Manager may not recruit
any  Saath ecommerce pvt ltd&#39;s Mysaathe website  Manager for any other business, with
the exception of a Manager who is personally referred by the former Manager. The Managers
and Company recognize that because crowd funding is conducted through networks of
independent Managers dispersed across the entire globe, and business is commonly conducted
via the Internet and telephone, an effort to narrowly limit the geographic scope of this non-
solicitation provision would render it wholly ineffective. Therefore, the Managers and Company
agree that this non-solicitation provision shall apply to all activities in which Saath ecommerce
pvt ltd&#39;s Mysaathe website  conducts operations.

The term &quot;recruit&quot; means actual or attempted solicitation, enrollment, encouragement or effort
to influence in any other way, either directly or through a third party, another  Saath
ecommerce pvt ltd&#39;s Mysaathe website   Manager to enroll or participate in a multilevel
marketing, network marketing or direct sales opportunity. This conduct constitutes recruiting
even if the Manager&#39;s actions are in response to an inquiry made by another Manager.</p>
<p>4.7.3 - Activity (Genealogy) Reports<br/>
Activity Reports made available for Manager access and viewing at  Saath ecommerce pvt ltd&#39;s
Mysaathe website   official website, are considered confidential. Manager access to their
Activity Reports is password protected. All Activity Reports and the information contained
therein are confidential and constitute proprietary information and business trade secrets
belonging to  Saath ecommerce pvt ltd&#39;s Mysaathe website  . Activity Reports are
provided to Managers in the strictest of confidence and are made available to Managers for the
sole purpose of assisting Managers in working with their respective Organizations in the
development of their  Saath ecommerce pvt ltd&#39;s Mysaathe website project. Managers
should use their Activity Reports to assist, motivate and train their Managers. The Manager
and  Saath ecommerce pvt ltd&#39;s Mysaathe website   agree that, but for this agreement of
confidentiality and nondisclosure,  Saath ecommerce pvt ltd&#39;s Mysaathe website   would
not provide Activity Reports to the Manager. A Manager shall not, on his or her own behalf, or
on behalf of any other person, partnership, association, corporation or other entity:</p>
<ul class="policy">
<li>Directly or indirectly disclose any information contained in any Activity Report to any third
party;</li>
<li>Directly or indirectly disclose the password or other access code to his or her Activity Report;</li>
<li> Use the information to compete with  Saath ecommerce pvt ltd&#39;s Mysaathe website   or
for any purpose other than promoting his or her Saath ecommerce pvt ltd&#39;s
Mysaathe website</li>
<li> Recruit or solicit any Manager of  Saath ecommerce pvt ltd&#39;s Mysaathe website   listed
on any report or in any manner attempt to influence or induce any Manager of Saath
ecommerce pvt ltd&#39;s Mysaathe website   to alter their business relationship with  Saath
ecommerce pvt ltd&#39;s Mysaathe website  ;</li>
<li>Use or disclose to any person, partnership, association, corporation or other entity any
information contained in any Activity Report.
Upon demand by the Company, any current or former Manager will return the original and all
copies of Activity Reports to the Company.</li>
</ul>

<br/><br/>
<h5>4.8 - Cross-Referring</h5>
<p>Actual or attempted cross-referring is strictly prohibited. &quot;Cross-Referring&quot; is defined as the
enrollment of an individual or entity that already has a current Manager Agreement on file
with  Saath ecommerce pvt ltd&#39;s Mysaathe website  , or who has had such an agreement
within the preceding 6 calendar months, within a different line of Referrership. The use of a

spouse or relative&#39;s name, trade names, assumed names or fictitious ID numbers to circumvent
this policy is prohibited. Managers shall not demean, discredit or defame other  Saath
ecommerce pvt ltd&#39;s Mysaathe website  Managers in an attempt to entice another
Manager to become part of the first Manager&#39;s organization. If a prohibited organization
transfer occurs,  Saath ecommerce pvt ltd&#39;s Mysaathe website   shall take disciplinary
action against the Manager(s) who engaged, acquiesced and/or knowingly participated in the
improper cross-referring. However, it shall be entirely within  Saath ecommerce pvt ltd&#39;s
Mysaathe website   discretion where in the genealogical structure, the cross-referred
organization in question shall be placed or otherwise distributed.<br/>
Because equities often exist in favor of both organizations, MANAGERS WAIVE ANY AND ALL
CLAIMS AND CAUSES OF ACTION AGAINST THE COMPANY FOR ITS DECISION REGARDING THE
FINAL DISPOSITION OR PLACEMENT OF THE CROSSREFERRED ORGANIZATION.</p>

<br/><br/>
<h5>4.9 - Errors or Questions</h5>
<p>If a Manager has questions about or believes any errors have been made regarding share
funding, Activity Reports, or charges, the Manager must notify the Manager Care Department
at  Saath ecommerce pvt ltd&#39;s Mysaathe website  headquarters by email,
at support@Mysaathe.org, within 15 days of the date of the purported error or incident
in question.  Saath ecommerce pvt ltd&#39;s Mysaathe website   will not be responsible for
any errors, omissions or problems not reported to the Company within 15 days.</p>

<br/><br/>
<h5>4.10 - Rejection of Projects and Potential Projects</h5>
<p>Company at its sole discretion reserves the right to accept or reject the application and
placement of any and all prospective projects for Crowd Funding on its platform. Company
expressly rejects any and all projects of an illegal, or unethical manner, or any projects that the
Company at its sole discretion believes is not in the best interests of the Company and its
standards. Company further reserves the right to accept or reject any and all potential
Managers. Prospective Manager acknowledges and agrees that Managership in Company is not
a right, and that they and their project must be accepted by Company.</p>

<br/><br/>
<h5>4.11 - Governmental Approval or Endorsement</h5>
<p>No international, federal or state regulatory agencies or officials approve or endorse any
project. Therefore, Managers shall not represent or imply that  Saath ecommerce pvt ltd&#39;s
Mysaathe website   or its Share Distribution Formula have been &quot;approved,&quot; &quot;endorsed&quot;
or otherwise sanctioned by any government agency.</p>

<br/><br/>
<h5>4.13 - Identification</h5>
<p>Upon enrollment, the Company will provide a unique Manager Identification Number to the
Manager by which he or she will be identified.</p>

<br/><br/>
<h5>4.14 - Income Taxes</h5>
<p>Each Manager is responsible for paying local, state and federal taxes on any taxable funds
generated as a Manager.  Saath ecommerce pvt ltd&#39;s Mysaathe website   is simply acting

as a conduit between donators and projects and does not pay any commissions or bonuses to
projects.  Saath ecommerce pvt ltd&#39;s Mysaathe website   is therefore not responsible for
determining taxability of funds received by each project.</p>

<br/><br>
<h5>4.15 - Independent Contractor Status</h5>
<p>Managers are independent contractors and are not purchasers of a franchise or a business
opportunity. The agreement between  Saath ecommerce pvt ltd&#39;s
Mysaathe website   and its Managers does not create an employer/employee
relationship, agency, partnership or joint venture between the Company and the Manager.
Managers shall not be treated as an employee for his or her services or for federal or state tax
purposes. All Managers are responsible for paying local, state and federal taxes due, if any,
from all funds received as a Project Manager. The Project Manager has no authority (expressed
or implied) to bind the Company to any obligation. Each Manager shall establish his or her own
goals, hours, and methods of sale, so long as he or she complies with the terms of the Manager
Agreement Form, and these Policies and Procedures, and applicable laws.<br/>

adopted by Saath ecommerce pvt ltd&#39;s Mysaathe website   are proprietary trade names,
trademarks and service marks of  Saath ecommerce pvt ltd&#39;s Mysaathe website  . As
such, these marks are of great value to  Saath ecommerce pvt ltd&#39;s Mysaathe website 
and are supplied to Managers for their use only in an expressly authorized manner. Use of

any other variations of the core trademarked name.<br/>
It is also prohibited for a Manager to use any website materials on a website that references or

Mysaathe website.</p>

<br/><br/>
<h5>4.18 - Laws and Ordinances</h5>
<p>Managers shall comply with all federal, state and local laws and regulations in the conduct of
their projects. Many cities and counties have laws regulating certain home-based businesses.

Manager that an ordinance applies to him or her, the Manager shall comply with the law.</p>

<br/><br/>
<h5>4.19 - Minors</h5>
<p>Managers shall not enroll or recruit individuals under the age of 18 into the Saath ecommerce
pvt ltd&#39;s Mysaathe website   program.</p>

<br/><br/>
<h5>4.20 - Actions of Household Managers or Affiliated Individuals.</h5>
<p>If any Manager of a Manager&#39;s household, family, or other affiliated individual engages in any
activity that, if performed by the Manager, would violate any provision of the Agreement, such
activity will be deemed a violation by the Manager and  Saath ecommerce pvt ltd&#39;s
Mysaathe website   may take disciplinary action pursuant to the Statement of Policies
against the Manager.</p>

<br/><br/>
<h5>4.21 - One  Saath ecommerce pvt ltd&#39;s Mysaathe website crowdfunding  Project per
Manager</h5>
<p>A Manager may operate or have an ownership interest as a sole proprietorship in only
one  Saath ecommerce pvt ltd&#39;s Mysaathe website  CrowdFunding project, and only one
Crowd Funding project. No individual may have, operate or sharing from more than one  Saath
ecommerce pvt ltd&#39;s Mysaathe website   project. Individuals of the same family unit may
enter into or have an interest in more than one Saath ecommerce pvt ltd&#39;s
Mysaathe website   CrowdFunding Project provided a family Manager acts as the direct
Referrer of the other. A &quot;family unit&quot; is defined as spouses, domestic partners and dependent
children living at or doing business at the same address.<br/>
An exception to the one-project-per-Manager rule will be considered on a case-by-case basis if
two Managers marry. Requests for exceptions to this policy must be submitted in writing to the
Compliance Department.</p>

<br/><br/>
<h5>4.22 - Referring</h5>
<p>All active Managers in good standing have the right to refer and enroll others into  Saath
ecommerce pvt ltd&#39;s Mysaathe website  . Each prospective Manager has the ultimate
right to choose his or her own Referrer. If two Managers claim to be the Referrer of the same
new Manager, the Company shall regard the first application received by the Company as
controlling.</p>


<br/><br/>
<h5>4.23 - Stacking</h5>
<p>&quot;Stacking&quot; is strictly prohibited. The term &quot;stacking&quot; includes: (a) violating the one-project-per-
household rule and/or (b) enrolling fictitious or non-participating individuals or entities into
the  Saath ecommerce pvt ltd&#39;s Mysaathe website  Share Distribution Formula, in an
attempt to manipulate the Share Distribution Formula.</p>

<br/><br/>
<h5>4.24 - Telemarketing</h5>
<p>The Federal Trade Commission and the Federal Communications Commission each have laws
that restrict telemarketing practices.<br/>
Both federal agencies (as well as a number of states) have &quot;do not call&quot; regulations as part of
their telemarketing laws. While you may not consider yourself a &quot;telemarketer&quot; in the
traditional sense of the word, these regulations broadly define the term &quot;telemarketer&quot; and
&quot;telemarketing&quot; so that your inadvertent action of calling someone whose telephone number is
listed on the federal &quot;do not call&quot; registry could cause you to violate the law. Moreover, these
regulations must not be taken lightly, as they carry significant penalties (up to $11,000.00 per
violation).<br/>
Therefore, Managers must not engage in telemarketing relative to the operation of their  Saath
ecommerce pvt ltd&#39;s Mysaathe website   projects. The term &quot;telemarketing&quot; means the
placing of one or more telephone calls to an individual or entity to induce the purchase of
a  Saath ecommerce pvt ltd&#39;s Mysaathe website   product or service, or to recruit them
for the  Saath ecommerce pvt ltd&#39;s Mysaathe website   platform. &quot;Cold calls&quot; made to
prospective customers or Managers that promote either  Saath ecommerce pvt ltd&#39;s
Mysaathe website   products or services or the  Saath ecommerce pvt ltd&#39;s
Mysaathe website   CrowdFunding opportunity constitute telemarketing and are
prohibited. However, a telephone call(s) placed to a prospective customer or Manager (a
&quot;prospect&quot;) is permissible under the following situations:</p>
<ul class="policy">
<li>If the Manager has an established business relationship with the prospect. An
&quot;established business relationship&quot; is a relationship between a Manager and a prospect
based on the prospect&#39;s purchase, rental or lease of goods or services from the
Manager, or a financial transaction between the prospect and the Manager, within the
18 months immediately preceding the date of a telephone call to induce the prospect&#39;s
purchase of a product or service.</li>
<li> The prospect&#39;s personal inquiry or application regarding a product or service offered by
the Manager within the 3 months immediately preceding the date of such a call.</li>
<li> If the Manager receives written and signed permission from the prospect authorizing
the Manager to call. The authorization must specify the telephone number(s) that the
Manager is authorized to call.</li>
<li> You may call family members, personal friends and acquaintances. An &quot;acquaintance&quot; is
someone with whom you have at least a recent first-hand relationship (i.e., you have
recently personally met him or her). Bear in mind, however, that if you make a habit of

&quot;card collecting&quot; with everyone you meet and subsequently calling them, the FTC may
consider this a form of telemarketing that is not subject to this exemption. Thus, if you
engage in calling &quot;acquaintances,&quot; you must make such calls on an occasional basis only
and not make this a routine practice.</li></ul>
<p>In addition, Managers shall not use automatic telephone dialing systems relative to the
operation of their  Saath ecommerce pvt ltd&#39;s Mysaathe website   participation. The
term &quot;automatic telephone dialing system&quot; means equipment which has the capacity to (a)
store or produce telephone numbers to be called using a random or sequential number
generator and (b) to dial such numbers.</p>

<br/><br/>


<h5>5.1 - Change of Address or Telephone</h5>
<p>To ensure timely delivery of support materials, it is critically important that  Saath ecommerce
pvt ltd&#39;s Mysaathe website  files are current. Managers planning to move should
email  Saath ecommerce pvt ltd&#39;s Mysaathe website   corporate office,
at Mysaathe7@gmail.com, their new address and telephone numbers. To guarantee

to the  Saath ecommerce pvt ltd&#39;s Mysaathe website   corporate offices. While  Saath
ecommerce pvt ltd&#39;s Mysaathe website   welcomes constructive input, negative
comments and remarks made in the field by Managers about the Company, its products or

example for their Managers, Managers must not disparage, demean or make negative remarks
about  Saath ecommerce pvt ltd&#39;s Mysaathe website  , other  Saath ecommerce pvt ltd&#39;s
Mysaathe website   Managers,  Saath ecommerce pvt ltd&#39;s

applicant signs a Manager Agreement. Additional copies of Policies and Procedures can be
found on the  Saath ecommerce pvt ltd&#39;s Mysaathe website   website
at www.Mysaathe.org, or in your back office under the tab Policies and Procedures.</p>

the violation directly to the attention of the  Saath ecommerce pvt ltd&#39;s

appropriate action.</p>

<br/><br/>

shall be settled by arbitration administered by the Inter-American Commercial Arbitration
Commission (IACAC) or other recognized arbitration service, under its Commercial Arbitration
Rules, and judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court
having jurisdiction thereof. Managers waive all rights to trial by jury or to any court. All
arbitration proceedings shall be held in Panama City, Panama, unless the laws of the state in
which a Manager resides expressly require the application of its laws, in which case the
arbitration shall be held in the capital of that state. All parties shall be entitled to all discovery

<center><h4>SECTION 8 - INACTIVITY AND CANCELLATION</h4></center>
<br/><br/>



<h5>8.1 - Effect of Cancellation</h5>
<p>So long as a Manager remains active and complies with the terms of the Manager Agreement
and these Policies and Procedures,  Saath ecommerce pvt ltd&#39;s Mysaathe website  shall
distribute funds to such Manager in accordance with the Share Distribution Formula. A
Manager&#39;s accumulated share of funds constitute the entire consideration for the Manager&#39;s
efforts in generating funds and all activities related to generating funds (including building a
Sharing Organization). Following a Manager&#39;s termination for inactivity, or voluntary or
involuntary termination of his or her Manager Agreement (all of these methods are collectively
referred to as &quot;termination&quot;), the former Manager shall have no right, title, claim or interest to
the organization that he or she operated, or any funds generated by the organization. A
Manager whose project is terminated will lose all rights as a Manager. In the event of
termination, Managers agree to waive all rights they may have, including but not limited to
property rights, to their former organization and to any funds derived from the activities of his
or her former organization.</p>
<p>Following a Manager&#39;s termination of his or her Manager Agreement, the former Manager shall
not hold himself or herself out as a  Saath ecommerce pvt ltd&#39;s Mysaathe website 
Manager. A Manager whose Manager Agreement is terminated shall receive funds only for the
amount in his or her wallet prior to cancellation (less any amounts withheld during an
investigation preceding an involuntary termination).</p>

<br/><br/>
<h5>8.2 - Involuntary Termination<h5>
<p>A Manager&#39;s violation of any of the terms of the Agreement, including any amendments that
may be made by  Saath ecommerce pvt ltd&#39;s Mysaathe website   in its sole discretion,
may result in any of the sanctions listed in Section 7.1, including the involuntary termination of
his or her Manager Agreement. Cancellation shall be effective on the date on which written

notice is mailed, faxed or delivered to an express courier to the Manager&#39;s last known address
(or fax number), or to his or her attorney, or when the Manager receives actual notice of
termination, whichever occurs first.</p>

<br/><br/>
<h5>8.3 - Voluntary Termination</h5>
<p>A Manager has a right to cancel, at any time, regardless of reason. Termination must be
submitted in writing to the Company at its principal business address. The written notice must
include the Manager&#39;s signature, printed name, and address and Manager ID number.
Managers who have resigned may re-apply to become a Manager with  Saath ecommerce pvt
ltd&#39;s Mysaathe website  CrowdFunding after 6 months. A Manager&#39;s position is subject
to termination due to inactivity after being inactive for 6 full calendar months.</p>

<br/><br/>
<h5>8.4 - Non-Renewal</h5>
<p>A Manager may also voluntarily cancel his or her Manager Agreement by failing to maintain the
Agreement annually. The Company may also elect not to renew a Manager&#39;s Agreement.</p>

<br/><br/>
<h5>8.5 - Complete Agreement</h5>
<p>These Policies and Procedures, any and all modifications made by the Company, along with the
Terms and Conditions and the Share Distribution Formula make up the entire agreement
between Manager and Company.</p>
